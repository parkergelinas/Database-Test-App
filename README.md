# Database-Test-App
Here I've made a basic python database app with several inputs for data, with the abilities to show records, delete records and edit records. 


# The image below is the initial layout upon opening the app.

# Next we have the inputs filled.

# Once the form has been filled out and added to the database, hitting show records makes them appear below.

# In the Select ID box, enter the file ID, the number on the right of the name, and press either edit or delete as you wish, note edit pops up the 2nd window, and delete removes the record from the database entirely.
